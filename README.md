# FutureTech README

This Android application is built using Kotlin and follows a **Single Activity Architecture** with MVVM architecture. It utilizes several key libraries, including the Navigation library, Retrofit library, and Room database.

## Features

The app is divided into three main parts:

### 1. Food

- Each recipe includes procedural videos and a list of materials required.
- Users can browse, search, and bookmark their favorite recipes.

### 2. Fitness

- The fitness section includes a BMI Calculator.
- Users can input their weight and height to calculate their BMI.
- In development: A calorie counter will be added, allowing users to track their calorie intake based on exercise.

- This part of the app provides historical rainfall data.
- Users can enter specific latitude and longitude coordinates to retrieve historical rainfall values for a given location.
